<i>February 2013 - August 2015.</i><br>
Beginning as a regular team member, I worked my way up to Team Two Cash. As Team<br> Two Cash, I managed
the area up by the cash registers, the prize counter, and the salad<br> bar. I made sure everyone took their
breaks on time and helped any team members if they<br> were not sure how to do a particular task. My other
responsibility as Team Two Cash<br> included training new team members in general areas of the store and
at the cash register.<br> On weekends, I usually did birthday parties and helped manage the showroom crew.

<i>September 2015 - Present</i><br>
I started in the front of the house as a cashier. As a cashier my responsibilities included <br>taking orders,
getting the food to customers, and keeping the dining area clean. After a<br> few months, I was cross-trained
in the kitchen. As a regular crew member, my<br> responsiblities in the back include cooking the food at the
various stations, sending food<br> out the front of house crew, and making sure the cooking areas stay clean.
In September<br> 2016, I was promoted to Bird Specialist. As Bird Specialist, I have all of the same<br> responsibilities
as a regular kitchen crew member plus I must manage the kitchen,<br> continually make sure the working stations
are food safe, make sure everyone gets their<br> breaks, and set the general pace of the shift.

<h2><b>Coding Projects</b></h2>
<p>
<h3><b>Cane's FM</b></h3>
At Cane's, I have also had the oppurtunity to work on special coding projects. The first<br> project, currently
called <i>Cane's FM</i> is essentially a biased randomizer. At Cane's, we have<br> five different areas of emphasis
that we need to focus on. The managers go into an excel<br> file and rank different issues that need to be fixed
in each area of emphasis. Then, my<br> code takes those ranked lists in, randomly picks two of those issues, and
prints out the<br> issues it picks. The process is not completely random, however, as the issues closer to the<br>
top of the list are more likely to be printed out compared to issues that are lower on the<br> list. The list of
picked issues is printed out and displayed in the kitchen and the front of<br> the house so that everyone can
look through the issues and work on them.
<br>
<h3><b>Configurator</b></h3>
My current project is called a <i>Configurator</i>. This project is being done for the company<br> my dad works
for, FleetPride. It is an program that asks questions, and, depending on how<br> the questions are answered,
produces a part number. It does this for several different<br> categories including pumps and cab controls. It
is expected to be used by employees who<br> take orders by phone. They will be able to get all of the part numbers
while also being<br> able to look up those part numbers to see if they have those specfic parts in stock. They<br>
will be looking up part numbers in their own system that FleetPride already has. The<br> project is still in
the beginning stages, however, a fully working model is essentially<br> completed.
